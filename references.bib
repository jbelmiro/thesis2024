  abstract = {The overarching goal of this study was to investigate the characteristics of fire at an archaeological site (mainly the intensity and duration of a fire event) through the analysis of lithic heat fractures in a lithic assemblage. Previous attempts to understand these characteristics have relied on the analysis of organic fire residues, such as charcoal, and/or the presence of hearths or combustion features. While the effects of heating variables on lithic fracturing have been studied, the number of controlled experiments attempting to quantify lithic heat fracture is small. Thus, we conducted controlled experiments to evaluate the effects of temperature and duration of heating on the formation of potlid fractures on the external surfaces of flakes. We used a laboratory furnace to modify the intensity of heat (temperature) and the timing of the heating exposure (duration) while keeping the ramp rate and cooling time constant. Based on the exposure of 45 knapped flint flakes to this protocol, we observed that there is an association between the intensity of lithic heat fracture (i.e., the high frequency of potlidding in lithic assemblages) and high temperature fire (483 {\textopenbullet}C [900{\textopenbullet}F]). A longer heating duration ({$>$}4 h) had no detectable influence when the effect of heating temperature and ramp rate was controlled. Applying our experimental results to burned flints from the Middle Paleolithic site of Ain Difla, Jordan, we inferred that those lithics were exposed to high temperature fire with close proximity to the heat source because of the high frequency of potlidded flakes in this assemblage. An important implication of these results is that, in the absence of hearths or combustion features, burned lithics can be valuable indicators of the intensity of fire, the type of exposure, and duration of heating at an archaeological site.},

  abstract = {Studying lithic raw material sourcing, processing and distribution is helpful when trying to reconstruct the territory, ecology, and cultural practices of Neanderthal groups. The use of multiple methods in such analyses allows for more refined characterizations to be made, helping to distinguish between materials better than any single method. Although 85\% of the raw materials making up the Mousterian assemblage at the Navalma{\'i}llo Rock Shelter (Pinilla del Valle, Madrid Region of Spain) correspond to the available local geological resources, 10\% is made of white/beige chert, which is not registered in regional geological cartography. Petrographic and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses were performed to determine the origin of this white/beige chert and thus shed light on the procurement strategies of the Neanderthal groups that occupied the rock shelter. The results show this chert to correspond to three different types of rock: quartz--kaolinite rocks from dykes, cretaceous marine cherts, and quartz fillings of cavities/fractures. These findings are in accordance with the geological features and formations present in the Lozoya valley, as recorded during a geoarchaeological survey, and indicate that the Neanderthals occupying the center of the Iberian Peninsula possessed a detailed knowledge of the landscape that allowed them to exploit its resources during MIS5a--early MIS4.},

Heating greatly improves flaking qualities, yielding a material judged second only to volcanic glasses in flaking properties. Temperatures above 275{$^\circ$}C induce marked weakness and brittleness in the stone. Heating yields the following observable changes: waxy , luster and frequent ripple marks in fresh flake scars, a distinct darkening in color, and decreased translucency. The stone tool collection from the Lower Hidasta Village site (32ME10) (A.D. 168().1780) indicates that heat treatment was selectively practiced with KRF tools requiring pressure flaking, occurring most commonly in arrowpoints.},

The set of controlled experiments reported here do not focus on fire per se, but rather on the effects of some of the most important variables underlying the transfer of heat to subsurface sediments. These variables, including temperature, duration, sediment type, moisture, and mineralogy, are altered here in ways that essentially bracket the range of conditions under which past fires may have existed. The results show that sediments as much as 10 cm directly below a heat source routinely reach temperatures of 200  C, with higher temperatures and greater depth of heat transfer possible with longer durations or higher surface temperatures. One of the implications of these results is that a surface can produce substantial thermal-alterations of archaeological artifacts and sediments deposited much earlier in the sequence. Likewise, there are significant implications for the analyses and chronometric dating of thermally altered sediments and burned artifacts.},

It reflects one of the many components of the Himalayan Orogenic systems of Tethyan oceanic crust discovered in Na{\dbend}galand at Meluri district of India and they have very well-preserved studies and can be identified to Upper Jurassic (Kimmeridgian-mid-Tithonian). As well as a continuous sequence of Kimmeridgian-mid-Tithonian, five radiola{\dbend}rian assemblages have been identified in this study. This is so far the first re{\dbend}covery of pelagic sediment assemblages (Radiolarians) from the Naga Hills Ophiolite complex. Samples of Naga Hills Ophiolite belts fell in the Sublitha{\dbend}renite, Litharenite, and Fe-shale Fe-sand area, and the A-CN-K diagram in{\dbend}dicates that these sediments in the source region were exposed deep to mod{\dbend}erate weathering conditions. In the discriminant plot, the Naga Hill-Ophiolite{\dbend}Chert samples occupy the field of origin of the sediment quartzose, and the log (K2O/Na2O) versus SiO2 samples fall into the active continental marginal field, and only one sample falls into an island arch, suggesting that the tec{\dbend}tonic framework of the Naga Hills-Chert samples was deposited in the active continental margin and the diagrams K2O/Al2O3 and MgO/Al2O3 illustrated the tectonic setting of the marine environment from Naga Hill Ophiolite Chert. Such findings have been consistent with the current geology of Naga Hills in the province of Nagaland},

We demonstrate that Gravettian ornament variability cannot be explained solely by isolation-by-distance. Analysis of Gravettian ornaments identified nine geographically discrete cultural entities across Europe. While broadly in agreement with palaeogenetic data, our results highlight a more complex pattern, with cultural entities located in areas not yet sampled by palaeogenetics and distinctive entities in regions inhabited by populations of similar genetic ancestry. Integrating personal ornament and biological data from other Palaeolithic cultures will elucidate the complex narrative of population dynamics of Upper Palaeolithic Europe.},

Shortages result from regional geological conditions and from behavior patterns that restrict access to raw material in certain contexts.

Our ECNM approach employed the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP) and used as input a combination of archaeological and geographic data, in conjunction with high-resolution paleoclimatic simulations for this time frame. The archaeological data consist of geographic coordinates of sites dated by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry to the LGM and attributed to the Solutrean and Epigravettian technocomplexes. The areas predicted by ECNM consistently outline the northern boundary of human presence at 22,000--20,000 cal BP. This boundary is mainly determined by climatic constraints and corresponds well to known southern limits of periglacial environments and permafrost conditions during the LGM. Differences between predicted ecological niches and known ranges of the Solutrean and Epigravettian technocomplexes are interpreted as Solutrean populations being adapted to colder and more humid environments and as reflecting influences of ecological risk on geographic distributions of cultures.},

The paper discusses issues of terminological ambiguities, chronological and geographical aspects of change, the emergence of what is viewed as the arch-types of modern forager societies, and the hotly debated and loaded issue of modern behavior. Finally, the various causes for the Upper Paleolithic revolution are enumerated, from the biological through the technocultural that relies on the analogy with the Neolithic revolution.},

  abstract = {Until recently, evidence of Neanderthal cave use in the Algarve (Southern Portugal) came only from the site of Ibn Ammar. Over the last couple of years, archaeological excavations inside another cave, Gruta da Companheira, yielded Mousterian stone tools associated with possible human fossils. The discovery of this assemblage is groundbreaking because it may contribute to enlighten the Neanderthal/cave relationship and explain the dearth of similar sites in the Algarve. Gruta da Companheira, however, is a complex karst system, which was partly destroyed during its accidental discovery. As result, the original entrance of the cave remains unknown, and it is unclear how sediments, archaeological materials and Neanderthals accessed the site. To tackle these issues, we combined geomorphological observations with speleological, Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) and Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) prospections. Our data indicate that Gruta da Companheira was probably accessed from the hilltop through a sub-vertical entrance. Additionally, our results suggest the existence of yet unexplored shallower cavities connected with the already known passages of Gruta da Companheira. These results will guide the opening of new excavation areas at the site. The limestone bedrock hosting Gruta da Companheira has been extensively dissolved by karst processes. Therefore, it is necessary to focus future research on the cave infillings to clarify whether Neanderthals exploited the cave's inner chambers or alternatively limited their occupations to the hilltop and geogenic processes reworked their materials into the endokarst system shortly after their stays. The deep karstification and partial collapse of the hill hosting Gruta da Companheira are common in limestone outcrops that occur throughout the Western Algarve. Poor visibility and poor accessibility of this karst area, densely covered with shrubby vegetation, are factors that need to be considered when addressing the scarcity of Middle Palaeolithic cave sites in this region.},

However, unlike other parts of Iberia, research on the management and acquisition of raw materials in the south and west of Iberia remains relatively underdeveloped. Despite significant knowledge about the technological practices of Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers from southern Portugal, particularly from studies conducted at the site of Vale Boi, there is a noticeable lack of focus on raw materials management. This paper presents the first comprehensive characterisation of chert raw materials from the Gravettian, Proto-Solutrean, and Solutrean occupations at Vale Boi, using both macroscopic and petrographic techniques. Our study reveals that the majority of chert found at Vale Boi originates locally, within a 20~km radius. However, a non-negligible portion of the chert comes from non-local sources, indicating\,{$>$}\,200~km raw material circulation from central Portugal and southern Spain.},

  abstract = {Southwestern Iberia has played a key role in characterizing Late Pleistocene human ecodynamics. Among other aspects of human behavior, chert procurement and management studies in this region have received increasing attention in the past two decades, especially focusing on the sites showing repeated human occupation, such as the case of Vale Boi (Southern Portugal). However, these studies have been very limited in their geographical scope, and mostly focused on brief macroscopic descriptions of the raw materials. To further our knowledge of the relationship between regional availability of raw materials and its impact on human adaptations and mobility, a more detailed approach to characterizing geological sources is needed. This paper characterizes chert raw materials location, diversity, and availability in a geologically well-defined region of southern Portugal - the Algarve. Through macroscopic and petrographic approaches, we provide a detailed characterization of geological chert sources to build a frame of reference for chert exploitation in the region. Our results show that there are four main chert formations in Algarve, and that despite the within-source variability, sufficient differences at macroscopic and petrographic levels are present to allow clear source attribution. These results provide a baseline for raw material studies in archaeological assemblages across southwestern Iberia, that will be essential to further characterize the dynamics of human behavior in some of the most important eco-cultural niches.},

  abstract = {During the 2014 and 2015 field season, we have excavated a new loci with an early Gravettian horizon in the Rock Shelter area of the site of Vale Boi, Southern Portugal. The loci is marked by a unique cache composed of close to 20 artifacts, most of which are pristine backed points in non-local chert. Due to typological characteristics, that includes points identical to those found in Pego do Diabo cave near Lisbon, and to those found in Vale Boi dated to 32.5 ka cal BP, as well as to the stratigraphical position and absolute depth of the finds, this cache is likely to be one of the earliest Gravettian occupations in southern Iberia. A series of AMS samples will be dated to confirm the estimated chronology of the cache. In this paper, we will discuss the importance of such a find, including technology, typology, raw material and use wear studies in addition to zooarchaeological and geoarchaeological analyses, for the arrival of first Anatomically Modern Humans to southern Iberia just prior to the H3 event.},

These models provide the estimation for possible demic dispersal routes for AMH at a stable spread rate of c. 0.7 km/year, with the likely origin in Central Europe at the site of Geissenklosterle in Germany and reaching all areas of the European landscape. The results imply that: 1. The arrival of the Gravettian populations into the far eastern European plains and to southern Iberia found regions with very low human occupation or even devoid of hominins; 2. Human demography was likely lower than previous estimates for the Upper Paleolithic; 3. The likely early AMH paths across Europe followed the European central plains and the Mediterranean coast to reach to the ends of the Italian and Iberian peninsulas.},

  abstract = {Nearly 200 rock art sites of Upper Paleolithic age are currently known on the Iberian Peninsula, in both caves and the open air. Over half are still concentrated in Cantabrian Spain and they span the period between c. 30--11~kya, but--tracking the course of human demography in this geographically circumscribed region--many of the images were probably painted or engraved during the Solutrean and, especially, Magdalenian. Dramatic discoveries and dating projects have significantly expanded the Iberian rock art record both geographically and temporally in recent years, in close coincidence with the growth of contemporaneous archeological evidence: cave art loci in Arag{\'o}n and Levante attributable to the Solutrean and Magdalenian, many cave art sites and a few open-air ones in Andaluc{\'i}a and Extremadura that are mostly Solutrean (in line with evidence of a major Last Glacial Maximum human refugium in southern Spain), the spectacular C{\^o}a Valley open-air complex in northern Portugal (together with a growing number of other such loci and one cave) that was probably created during the Gravettian-Magdalenian periods, and a modest, but important increase in proven cave and open-air sites in the high, north-central interior of Spain that are probably Solutrean and/or Magdalenian. Despite regional variations in decorated surfaces, themes, techniques and styles, there are broad (and sometimes very specific) pan-Iberian similarities (as well as ones with the Upper Paleolithic art of southern France) that are indicative of widespread human contacts and shared systems of symbols and beliefs during the late Last Glacial. As this Ice Age world and the forms of social relationships and ideologies that helped human groups survive in it came to an end, so too did the decoration of caves, rockshelters and outcrops, although in some regions other styles of rock art would return under very different conditions of human existence.},

Given the difficulty archaeologists face in developing theories of material culture, I suggest that guiding principles of engineering design offer potentially useful insights.In this article I discuss two design alternatives for optimizing the availability of any technical system - reliability and maintainability. Reliable systems are made so that they can be counted on to work when needed. Maintainable ones can easily be made to function if they are broken or not appropriate to the task at hand. Because these design alternatives have markedly different optimal applications and observably different physical characteristics, archaeologists can link the design of prehistoric weapons to environmental constraints and to specific hunting strategies. Ethnographic examples indicate that primitive hunters do use both reliable and maintainable systems in optimal situations.},

The populational kinetics of the hunter--gatherers in this vast area is characterized by the permanence of a refuge zone located in northern Aquitaine. The leptokurtic aspect of the density distributions of sites observed from the Aurignacian to the Glacial Maximum but not at the Magdalenian suggest occasional long distance movement such as raids or opportunistic expeditions. During the Glacial Maximum, the response to the cold is marked by the complete abandonment of the northern peripheral zone, a contraction of the population mainly on the first peripheral zone surrounding the refuge zone, but without geographical change of position of the refuge zone. An optimistic estimate of the meta-population size of hunter--gatherers, which takes into account the change of area size due to the sea level variation, goes from the Aurignacian, 4000, to the Glacial Maximum 8000. During the Magdalenian a demographic explosion occurred with 40,000 individuals.},

  abstract = {The presence of thermally altered and broken flint artifacts is common at archaeological sites. Most studies focus their attention on the effects of heat treatment on flint to improve knapping qualities, disregarding the effects of fire over flint under uncontrolled conditions. This paper aims to show how under uncontrolled heating processes flint artifacts develop different heat alterations (such as levels of breakage, presence of scales, etc.) as a result of vertical distribution, volume or raw material and to establish a gradient of rock changes and behavior. Artifacts where macroscopically analyzed and a series of uncontrolled heating experiments through the distribution of flint blanks under two hearths were carried out, allowing a comparison of the before and after of the blanks. Preliminary results show how levels of breakage, surface alteration or development of heat alteration features can be differentiated according to artifact volume, vertical distribution and level of surface alteration. Results also show how two different raw materials react differently to similar thermal impact, and how surface alteration reacts at different rhythm in the case of recycled artifacts. We conclude that levels of thermal alteration can be differentiated through macroscopic analysis of flint surface.},

  abstract = {The present work proposes to present the analysis results of the flaked stone artefacts from Lapa da Galinha, a cave necropolis, located in the Estremadura Limestone Massif, that is a classic example of the funerary practices of the 4th and 3rd millennium BCE. The excavation dates back to 1908, and it was performed by members of the current National Museum of Archaeology, resulting in an extensive votive ensemble, associated with a minimum number of 70 burials. The evident collective nature of the burials, the votive ensemble and the rituals there identified emphasise its ``Cave Megalithism'' character, an expression that invokes only one of the many facets of the complex phenomenon that is Megalithism. Since the Megalithic funerary structures, such as natural caves, are utilized over a long period of time, it's not easy- but not impossible- to reclaim in full, the events that took place. Focusing on the flaked stone artefacts, the main goal of this text is to contribute to the reconstruction of the belief system that characterizes the Neolithic and Chalcolithic communities from this region. Hence, the morpho-technological criteria, that followed previously established standards, and raw material analysis of the artefactual categories, even on a macroscopic level, were absolutely essential for us to suggest an extensive diachrony of the funerary use of the natural cave With that in mind, we reflected on the importance of the transformations that occur within the material culture exposed throughout the text and their chronological meaning, but also on the true potential of this artefactual category as a tool to build a solid perspective regarding the symbolism inherent to these funeral practices.},

The nature of thisoccupation is determined by the close link between the cave and the community which occupied it, both continuously and periodically. Throughout the occupation levels, the community's skillful control of technical processesand its remarkable knowledge on how to transform local primary resources, have shown that this community reached a high level of technological development. However, its main economic activity was related to agricultural and farming exploitation, particularly to stockbreeding.},

In Portugal, a reasonable number of archaeological sites are dated to this time-span, where significant changes in the economic and technological structures have been identified as a new cultural component: the Proto-Solutrean. Based on high-resolution paleoenvironmental data, chronological and archaeological evidence, our study demonstrates how HE2 might have been the main trigger for Proto-Solutrean cultural change. Technological intensification and diversification, as well as the adjustments made in land-use patterns towards an expansion of the social networks, are presented as the major climate-driven outcomes. Within the Panarchy and the Adaptive Cycle Model framework, these modifications consist of a Release and Reorganization moment of the hunteregatherer cultural systems that will lead to the appearance of the Solutrean technocomplex in Southwestern Iberia.},

The new interventions are marked by the application of modern excavation methods, based on the use of Total Station to record the threedimensional provenience of all artifacts, samples and structures. As a result, very relevant spatial and stratigraphic data is, for the first time in the history of archaeological excavations in Muge, available. The present paper focuses on the preliminary application of Kernel Density Estimation to the 3D provenience data from Layer 1 of Cabe{\c c}o da Amoreira. The projection of different artifacts categories allowed the identification of density patterns consistent with both the unstructured nature of the rocky cairn that covers the shellmidden and with the existence of post-depositional processes responsible for changes in the vertical and horizontal distribution of materials.},

  abstract = {One of the main elements in prehistoric research is the study of settlement patterns. In the last five decades, stemming partially from Binford's research on the topic, the idea of settlement patterns is based on site typology, including the traditional residential and logistic concepts. Both models of land use and exploitation are certainly marked by the notion of short-term occupation. This concept, used freely by many archaeologists, tends to rely on two main ideas: an occupation lasted a short span of time and resulted in a limited amount of material culture. Our aim, based on our results from various archaeological case studies dated to the Upper Paleolithic of Portugal, is to show that neither idea is necessarily correct: e.g. there may be short-term occupations with the production of large amounts of artifacts, such as lithic workshops; there might be very small collections, such as lithic caches, resulting from short occupations but with very long uses of the site; and most times, both are hardly differentiated within complex palimpsests. Our study shows that the common use of lithic volumetric density and retouch frequency is not always sufficient to differentiate between short and long-term occupations. Also, there are other variables that are more sensitive to indicate the duration of occupation of an archaeological context that should be used in the identification of time length.},

  abstract = {Quartz-based hunter-gatherer lithic technology is present around the world. It occurs particularly where the Precambrian crystalline basement outcrops, including South Africa, Northern Europe, North America and large areas of South America. However, little effort has been made to try to characterize its chemical composition to help understand either mobility strategies or exchange networks. We report here the results of a preliminary methodological approach comparing the chemical characterization of quartz from archaeological sites (quarries and residential types) and geological sources through different techniques: X-Ray Fluorescence, X-Ray Diffraction, SEM and EPMA analyses. The detection of trace elements from quartz outcrops and its comparison with artifacts from residential archaeological sites from the Ongamira valley (a mountainous region of Central Argentina) was undertaken in this work. The archaeological samples came from layers radiocarbon-dated to the Late Holocene (between ca. 3600 BP to 3000 BP) and are related to nomadic hunter-gatherer societies where the use of quartz for technology was predominant (representing more than 90 percent of the tools and debris in each archaeological site). As a result of the comparison, it was possible to establish positive or negative relationships between some of the quartz samples from the residential locus and the geological sources. Some results showed that the nearest quarries to the residential sites were not used at the residential camp. On the other hand, it was also possible to establish that non-local quartz outcrops located far away from the Ongamira valley were not present at any of the Ongamira sites. This shows us that rock procurement was oriented to the selective use of local raw material and therefore a low-range mobility strategy. Finally, it may be related to better local environmental conditions in the Late Holocene, when people did not need to travel so far for other resources or purposes.},

The site, located in the mountainous area of Picos de Europa National Park (more than 1000 m a.s.l.) close to the megalithic complex of Pe{\~n}a Oviedo, is characterized by the presence of hearths and charcoal remains, ancient pottery, and a rich lithic assemblage composed of siliceous rocks dating back to {$>$}8000 BP and linked to the first Holocene occupations of the Cantabrian Mountains. For the study of the rock shelter's lithic assemblage, a multi-analytical approach was used: SEM-EDS and XRD analyses were performed to define the microtextural characteristics of samples and to identify the amorphous/crystalline phases; physical and mechanical tests were conducted to define the petrophysical properties (density, porosity, imbibition and saturation indexes, mechanical strength) of the samples. Preliminary data of chemical compositions, obtained by portable XRF, are also presented. The results show that the different siliceous materials (quartzite, cherts, hyaline quartz) can be distinguished through the basic analytical techniques used here. In addition, most of the archaeological samples have mineralogical and petrographic features similar to the natural samples coming from nearby outcrops, corroborating the hypothesis of a local material supply. The presence of local sources of useful raw materials could have favoured the site's occupation. Finally, the diverse compositional and textural feature of the analysed materials result in different mechanical properties (porosity, density, hardness, workability), so they likely had different uses and technical functions.},

Modern postglacial populations are supposed to be representative of their Pleistocene ancestors, and their current distribution is assumed to reflect the different colonization success and dispersal patterns of refugial lineages. Yet, testing of phylogeographic models against ancestral genomes from glacial refugia has rarely been possible. Here we compare ND1 mitochondrial DNA variation in late Pleistocene (16,000-40,000 years before present), historical and contemporary Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations from northern Spain and other regions of western Europe. Our study demonstrates the presence of Atlantic salmon in the Iberian glacial refugium during the last 40,000 years and points to the Iberian Peninsula as the likely source of the most common haplotype within the Atlantic lineage in Europe. However, our findings also suggest that there may have been significant changes in the genetic structure of the Iberian refugial stock since the last ice age, and question whether modern populations in refugial areas are representative of ice age populations. A common haplotype that persisted in the Iberian Peninsula during the Pleistocene last glacial maximum is now extremely rare or absent from European rivers, highlighting the need for caution when making phylogeographic inferences about the origin and distribution of modern genetic types.},

Instruments used for elemental analysis generally must be operated in a controlled laboratory environment. Further, many methods require destruction of a small portion of the objects under investigation. These facts inhibit the application of chemical sourcing studies in a number of research contexts. Use of portable non-destructive instruments would resolve these issues. Sixty-eight obsidian artifacts from the site of Jiskairumoko, in southern Per{\'u}, were examined by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) and portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (PXRF). Results were compared for consistency in terms of source determination and individual element concentrations. Both instruments determined that the same sixty-six artifacts derived from the Chivay obsidian source and both identified the same two artifacts that could not be assigned to source. Individual element comparisons showed significant differences, but these can be resolved through instrument cross calibration, and differences had no bearing on source identification. PXRF was found suitable for determining obsidian sources in southern Per{\'u} and for identifying specimens that require more sensitive analytical methods such as, instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). Regular use of Chivay at Jiskairumoko suggests consistent trade relationships developed during the Archaic.},

Our analyses indicate that recent western European neandertals (,48 kyr) constitute a tightly defined group with low mitochondrial genetic variation in comparison with both eastern and older (.48 kyr) European neandertals. Using control region sequences, Bayesian demographic simulations provide higher support for a model of population fragmentation followed by separate demographic trajectories in subpopulations over a null model of a single stable population. The most parsimonious explanation for these results is that of a population turnover in western Europe during early Marine Isotope Stage 3, predating the arrival of anatomically modern humans in the region.},

Producing reliable geochemical data using a pXRF is a challenging process that requires the development of dedicated and matrix-matched empirical calibrations. Although a large field of applications, several research papers are still published using unquantified pXRF data, using manufacturers' built-in calibrations unsuitable for targeted rocks, or interpreting chemical concentrations without checking the limit of quantification of the pXRF spectrometer and its calibration model. In this paper, we present a general workflow for building an empirical calibration model for a pXRF spectrometer, from choosing reference materials to validating calibration's efficiency and quantifying its limit of quantification. We also compare the geochemical results on a sedimentary and an igneous rocks suite obtained from thirty-two calibration models that were built using different software available, including a simple homemade spreadsheet, the EasyCal calibration software, a free and open-source calibration app named CloudCal, and the built-in GeoMining and GeoExplorer calibrations provided by Bruker manufacturer on the Tracer 5 pXRF. This decoupled approach allows (i) to explore the pros and cons of each calibration model and determine which empirical calibration model brings the most accurate chemical concentration for a sedimentary and an igneous rock suite, (ii) to weigh the impact of each calibration parameter (type of regression line, spectral interferences, normalization, influence coefficients, multiple conditions of excitation and acquisition) on the accuracy of geochemical concentrations on rock samples and (iii) to bring innovative tools to assess the limits of quantification of a newly built calibration model.},

  abstract = {Population models seeking climate as a triggering factor for the extinction of Neandertals and the colonisation of Europe by Anatomically Modern Humans are contradictory due to uncertainties in the dating methods, in the cultural attribution of archaeological layers and to the lack of terrestrial continuous and well-dated palaeoclimatic sequences. This is particularly the case for the Iberian Peninsula where Neandertal populations seem to have survived later than in other regions of Europe. A review of the available palaeoclimatic evidence for OIS3 of Iberia reveals that this mainly consists of low resolution, fragmentary, ill-dated and often ill-interpreted records. Correlation between palaeoenvironmental sequences from two IMAGES pollen-rich deep sea cores and archaeological data from western Europe (the electronic archive of the radiocarbon dates is available at QSR website http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/quascirev) indicates that Aurignacian moderns colonised France and the north of Iberia at the onset of the H4 event. During this cold episode a probable contraction of Neandertal populations is recorded in southern Iberia where no Aurignacian settlements are detected. Such a decline in population density is correlated with the particular desert-steppe-like environments, made up of Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae and Ephedra, characterising the H4 of this area. While reducing the size of Neandertal populations, this inhospitable environment may have favoured their persistence in this region. Mainly exploiting herds of herbivores adapted to Graminees-rich grasslands, the Aurignacian moderns were probably not interested in colonising these arid Mediterranean biotopes, and did that only after the H4 event.},

  abstract = {The invention and proliferation of stone tool technology in the Early Stone Age (ESA) marks a watershed in human evolution. Patterns of lithic procurement, manufacture, use, and discard have much to tell us about ESA hominin cognition and land use. However, these issues cannot be fully explored outside the context of the physical attributes and spatio-temporal availability of the lithic raw materials themselves. The Olduvai Basin of northern Tanzania, which is home to both a wide variety of potential toolstones and a rich collection of ESA archaeological sites, provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the relationship between lithic technology and raw material characteristics. Here, we examine two attributes of the basin's igneous and metamorphic rocks: spatial location and fracture predictability. A total of 244 geological specimens were analyzed with non-destructive portable XRF (pXRF) to determine the geochemical distinctiveness of five primary and secondary sources, while 110 geological specimens were subjected to Schmidt rebound hardness tests to measure fracture predictability. Element concentrations derived via pXRF show significant differences between sources, and multivariate predictive models classify geological specimens with 75--80\% accuracy. The predictive models identify Naibor Soit as the most likely source for a small sample of three lithic artifacts from Bed II, which supports the idea that this inselberg served as a source of toolstone during the early Pleistocene. Clear patterns in fracture predictability exist within and between both sources and rock types. Fine-grained volcanics show high rebound values (associated with high fracture predictability), while finer-grained metamorphics and coarsegrained gneisses show intermediate and low rebound values, respectively. Artifact data from Bed I and II suggest that fracture predictability played a role in raw material selection at some sites, but other attributes like durability, expediency, and nodule size and shape were more significant.},

  abstract = {This paper evaluates the evidence for millennial-scale variability in pollen records of the last glacial (Marine Isotope Stages 4, 3, and 2; 73.5--14.7 calendar ka BP) from the European continent, taking into account information derived from long, continuous terrestrial records, the fragmentary northern European terrestrial record, and marine pollen records of the European continental margins. Pollen records from these numerous European sites provide evidence for multiple intervals of relatively warm and humid conditions during the last glacial, which promoted the establishment of grassland and shrub tundra in northwestern Europe, shrub- and forest-tundra in northeastern Europe, open boreal forest in central western Europe and the Alpine region, and open temperate forest in southern Europe. The northern limit for temperate forest development during these intervals was at {$\sim$}45{$^\circ$}N, with a subsequent northward transition to tundra across a latitudinal band of {$\sim$}15{$^\circ$} in western and central Europe, and a greater northward extension of boreal forest in eastern Europe, with boreal forest elements detected close to their present-day limits at {$\sim$}70{$^\circ$}N. A much smaller number of sites with sufficiently high temporal resolution provide evidence that warming intervals correspond to millennial-scale variability as recorded in Greenland ice cores. A synthesis of sites providing high-resolution terrestrial and marine records from Europe is undertaken in order to examine geographical and temporal patterns in the expression of Dansgaard--Oeschger (D--O) cycles in the European vegetation. Detailed comparison of temperate forest development at these sites during four specific D--O cycles (D--O 16--17, 14, 12 and 8) reveals contrasts between vegetation response at southernmost European latitudes (below 40{$^\circ$}N) and at latitudes above 40{$^\circ$}N. At southernmost latitudes, marked forest development occurred during all four D--O cycles including D--O 16--17 and 8, while at latitudes above 40{$^\circ$}N, forest development was stronger during D--O 14 and 12 than either D--O 16--17 or 8.},

The reliability of this record is supported by comparison with that of Padul (Sierra Nevada, Spain). Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 was characterised by fluctuations in Quercus forest cover in response to Dansgaard-Oeschger climate variability. MIS 2 was characterised by the dominance of semi-desert vegetation. Despite overall dry and cold conditions during MIS 2, Heinrich events (HEs) 2 and 1 were distinguished from the last glacial maximum by more intensely arid conditions. Taxon-specific vegetation responses to a tripartite climatic structure within the HEs are observed. In MIS 1, the B{\"o}lling-Aller{\o}d was marked by rapid afforestation, while a re-expansion of semi-desert environments occurred during the Younger Dryas. The maximum development of mixed Quercus forest occurred between 11.7 and 5.4 cal ka BP, with forest decline since 5.4 cal ka BP. On orbital timescales, a long-term expansion of semi-desert vegetation from MIS 3 into MIS 2 reflects global ice-volume trends, while Holocene arboreal decline reflects summer insolation decrease. The influence of precession on the amplitude of forest development and vegetation composition is also detected.},

  abstract = {Portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) instruments have gained considerable attention within the archaeological community. Few other recent instrumental developments have generated such debate. Much of this debate, which is dominated by scepticism over analytical performance, has occurred in informal settings. Rather than judge the use of pXRF based on unpublished work and conference banter, we conducted an extensive literature review of peer-reviewed research that used this technology. Our focus is developing an understanding of how, where, and why pXRF is being used in archaeology. What interests us most are research designs into which only pXRF could be integrated and the new research approaches these instruments may facilitate. Trends that emerged from the literature are surprising. For example, only 43\% of the archaeological ``pXRF'' papers actually involve handheld instruments. In addition, more than four-fifths of handheld pXRF in archaeology is apparently conducted in laboratory contexts. Only 3\% has been conducted in a fieldhouse or on-site laboratory, and 15\% at an excavation, on a survey, or inside a historic structure. Here we argue that, while the technical capability to analyse archaeological materials using portable instruments may exist, it is not necessarily true the methodological and theoretical frameworks are in place to allow such activities to be archaeologically successful and significant. Because handheld pXRF is uniquely suited to in situ analysis, we expect the first changes in methodological and theoretical approaches will involve space, context, and related frameworks.},

  abstract = {A link between climate change and human evolution during the Pleistocene has often been assumed but rarely tested. At the macro-evolutionary level Foley showed for hominids that extinction, rather than speciation, correlates with environmental change as recorded in the deep sea record. Our aim is to examine this finding at a smaller scale and with high-resolution environmental and archaeological archives. Our interest is in changing patterns of human dispersal under shifting Pleistocene climates during the last glacial period in Europe. Selecting this time frame and region allows us to observe how two hominid taxa, Neanderthals and Cr{\^o}-Magnons, adapted to climatic conditions during oxygen isotope stage 3. These taxa are representative of two hominid adaptive radiations, termed terrestrial and aquatic, which exhibited different habitat preferences but similar tolerances to climatic factors. Their response to changing ecological conditions was predicated upon their ability to extend their societies in space and time. We examine this difference further using a database of all available radiocarbon determinations from western Europe in the late glacial. These data act as proxies for population history, and in particular the expansion and contraction of regional populations as climate changed rapidly. Independent assessment of these processes is obtained from the genetic history of Europeans. The results indicate that climate affects population contraction rather than expansion. We discuss the consequences for genetic and cultural diversity which led to the legacy of the Ice Age: a single hominid species, globally distributed.},

In this book, which succeeds and replaces The Palaeolithic Settlement of Europe, published by Cambridge University Press in 1986, Clive Gamble challenges the established view that the social life of Europeans over the 500,000 years of the European Palaeolithic must remain a mystery. In the past forty years archaeologists have recovered a wealth of information from sites throughout the continent. Professor Gamble now introduces a new approach to this material. He examines the archaeological evidence from stone tools, hunting and campsites for information on the scale of social interaction, and the forms of social life. Taking a pan-European view of the archaeological evidence, he reconstructs ancient human societies, and introduces new perspectives on the unique social experience of human beings.},

Here we use an intermediate-complexity climate model to investigate the stability of glacial climate, and we find that only one mode of Atlantic Ocean circulation is stable: a cold mode with deep water formation in the Atlantic Ocean south of Iceland. However, a `warm' circulation mode similar to the present-day Atlantic Ocean is only marginally unstable, and temporary transitions to this warm mode can easily be triggered. This leads to abrupt warm events in the model which share many characteristics of the observed Dansgaard--Oeschger events. For a large freshwater input (such as a large release of icebergs), the model's deep water formation is temporarily switched off, causing no strong cooling in Greenland but warming in Antarctica, as is observed for Heinrich events. Our stability analysis provides an explanation why glacial climate is much more variable than Holocene climate.},

A significant number of the chipped stone artefacts discovered here are of obsidian, a raw material not native to the peninsula and one that ultimately must have been brought in from outside. All of the obsidian artefacts recovered from the Bozburun Peninsula were analysed using a portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometer to identify their geological provenance. Our results indicate the presence of four distinct obsidian sources in Bozburun: Melos (Cyclades) with its two separate outcrops, Giali A (Dodecanese), and Go{\textasciidieresis}ll{\"u}dag{\textasciibreve} East (Cappadocia). The variety of sources represented in the peninsula and the long distances involved attest to the prehistoric con\- nectivity in a region well suited to the movement of people and materials between the Aegean archipelago and the Anatolian mainland. Some of the geometric microliths, which were previously assigned to the final part of the Pleistocene and the earlier stages of the Holocene based on typological criteria, were determined to be coming from the island of Melos. If the typological assessment holds, this occurrence in the Bozburun Peninsula may mark the earliest occurrence of Melos obsidian in Anatolia, long before it was widely distributed in the Neolithic period.},

  abstract = {The Sant Gen{\'i}s Formation is located in the NE of the Iberian Peninsula (Catalonia, Spain) and is dated to the Priabonian (upper Eocene), being part of the evaporitic formations of the margin of the Ebro Basin. It is formed by a succession of sandy lutites, occasional limestone layers, marls, and local stratified gypsum and cherts, including the Sant Mart{\'i} de Tous chert. The Sant Mart{\'i} de Tous chert type is confirmed by its abundance at specific locations within the territory (NE Iberian Peninsula). This is an important raw material procurement area, as evidenced by the presence of this chert in the main prehistoric sites of the region (e.g., Abric Roman{\'i}) and the constant discovery of new sites in the area around the Sant Gen{\'i}s Formation, especially from the Neolithic period onwards (e.g., Cal Sitjo, La Guinardera Nord workshop). All these features, together with the great heterogeneity of the Cenozoic evaporitic cherts, prompted us to carry out a multi-proxy characterization for obtaining a valid criterion by which to identify this chert in the archaeological record. This very heterogeneity hampers the macroscopic characterization of archaeological cherts (e.g., at Abric Roman{\'i}), but through petrographic analysis we have been able to identify their origins and, albeit to a lesser extent, their lithostratigraphic unit of provenance within the formation. The complementary mineralogical and geochemical techniques applied in this study show that, although it is difficult to establish an exact origin, through intensive sampling and criteria such as the differential presence of Fe and Ca, some differences among the siliceous varieties within a formation can be detected.},

The source of this stone, known in the archeological literature as ``El Sauz chert,'' are two small bedrock outcrops in Starr County associated with altered rhyolitic ash of the Catahoula Formation. Physical characteristics, field evidence and major element chemical composition are used to infer an in situ origin of the chert associated with the devitrification of the volcanic ash and the remobilization of silica by ground and meteoric water. Distinctive characteristics of El Sauz chert include abundant vugs, opalized veins, smeared colorations, high aluminum content, and pale yellowish-green fluorescence under short-wave ultraviolet light. These geologically distinctive characteristics distinguish this material from other cherts and, as a result, have important implications for archaeologists interested in prehistoric exchange and resource procurement.},

Steep-edge flakes are classified as               purpunpa               and serve as woodworking scrapers, while flakes with acute edge-angles are classed as               tjimari               and are used as knives for cutting skin and tendons. Microscopic study has further revealed that woodworking scrapers show a distinctive pattern of use-wear. Some trial comparisons are also attempted between ethnographic Aboriginal woodworking scrapers and Quina-type scrapers of Bordes' Quina-Ferrassie facies of the Mousterian in order to suggest the value of comparing ethnographically known tools with archaeological specimens.},

Comparable work has yet to be developed for non-vitreous artefacts. We report results of pXRF analysis for a sample of grey to black (mafic) aboriginal hatchets from Sydney and adjacent coastal regions to the north and south. The study shows both broad and detailed classification is achievable depending on rock type and degree of elemental depletion or enrichment of the samples. PXRF analysis reveals not only distinct patterns of resource use between the three regions of this study but also enables a high degree of geographic resolution in the case of the basalt artefacts of our sample. We conclude that non-destructive pXRF is effective for reliable characterisation of non-vitreous stone artefacts that have a sufficiently complex and enriched compositional signature (i.e., unaltered basalts); with {$\sim$}50\% of the basalt hatchets in our sample matched with spatially and geologically specific sources.},

Most research considering hunter-gatherer mobility, however, concentrates primarily on the total distance moved by a group per annum. This paper de\- velops a novel metric, the Distance/Frequency Index (DFI), which describes a continuum between relatively frequent, short moves and relatively infrequent, long moves, and is derived to be orthogonal to total distance moved per annum. Multiple regressions of the DFI on a series of important demographic, social, and economic variables demonstrate that it correlates positively with population density and negatively with group size, percentage hunting in the diet, mean annual precipitation, and effective temperature. Analyses of a more recently collated subset of these data suggest that the correlations with group size and effective temperature are particularly robust. The DFI can also be related to a number of measures of occupation intensity and duration derived from archaeological assemblages, and to existing models of residential and logistical mobility. The DFI thus provides a valuable second axis of variation in hunter-gatherer mobility.},

  abstract = {The concentration of radiocarbon (14C) differs between ocean and atmosphere. Radiocarbon determinations from samples which obtained their 14C in the marine environment therefore need a marine-specific calibration curve and cannot be calibrated directly against the atmospheric-based IntCal20 curve. This paper presents Marine20, an update to the internationally agreed marine radiocarbon age calibration curve that provides a non-polar global-average marine record of radiocarbon from 0--55 cal kBP and serves as a baseline for regional oceanic variation. Marine20 is intended for calibration of marine radiocarbon samples from non-polar regions; it is not suitable for calibration in polar regions where variability in sea ice extent, ocean upwelling and air-sea gas exchange may have caused larger changes to concentrations of marine radiocarbon. The Marine20 curve is based upon 500 simulations with an ocean/atmosphere/biosphere box-model of the global carbon cycle that has been forced by posterior realizations of our Northern Hemispheric atmospheric IntCal20 14C curve and reconstructed changes in CO2 obtained from ice core data. These forcings enable us to incorporate carbon cycle dynamics and temporal changes in the atmospheric 14C level. The box-model simulations of the global-average marine radiocarbon reservoir age are similar to those of a more complex three-dimensional ocean general circulation model. However, simplicity and speed of the box model allow us to use a Monte Carlo approach to rigorously propagate the uncertainty in both the historic concentration of atmospheric 14C and other key parameters of the carbon cycle through to our final Marine20 calibration curve. This robust propagation of uncertainty is fundamental to providing reliable precision for the radiocarbon age calibration of marine based samples. We make a first step towards deconvolving the contributions of different processes to the total uncertainty; discuss the main differences of Marine20 from the previous age calibration curve Marine13; and identify the limitations of our approach together with key areas for further work. The updated values for {$\Delta$}R, the regional marine radiocarbon reservoir age corrections required to calibrate against Marine20, can be found at the data base http://calib.org/marine/.},

  abstract = {The Technological studies of the Galician prehistory have focused on the chrono-cultural characterization of the lithic assemblages, obliterating the studies of raw material procurement strategies. On the other side, the predominance of local raw materials, such as quartz and quartzite, has placed the research on flint implements in a secondary role, a priori considered as a scarce resource in the region. Although some outcrops have been discovered, usually related to hydrothermal contexts, they have not been properly described or analysed, preventing us from getting a good knowledge about their circulation patterns across NW Iberia.Nevertheless, the works conducted during the last two decades allow us to obtain a initial framework about the evolution of the role played by flint in the Prehistoric lithic assemblages. Although during the Lower and Middle Palaeolithic it is a scarce resource, from the Upper Palaeolithic onwards there is an increasing demand leading to the discovery and exploitation of new outcrops and a higher incidence of flint in the lithic assemblages, linked to specific cha{\^i}nes op{\'e}ratoires. Last approaches in the Late Prehistory studies have shown the existence of material from allochthonous and distant origin, specially the long blades linked to the megalithic grave-goods, along with the punctual exploitation of autochthonousflint outcrops.},

  abstract = {The Cantabrian Zone (N of Spain) is characterized by an occurrence of Palaeozoic age materials, mainly belonging to the Devonian and Carboniferous. Among the different lithologies, certain facies contain black chert and radiolarite in a total of 13 geological formations. Textural (de visu, stereomicroscope and thin sections), mineralogical (X-ray diffraction) and geochemical (X-ray fluorescence and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry) analyses have been carried out to describe the silicifications. All these data have made it possible to differentiate several varieties of chert and radiolarite that crop out in the Cantabrian Zone. Chert and radiolarite are raw materials that were used by the prehistoric groups that occupied this territory for thousands of years. The data obtained in this study will allow us to define the chert and radiolarite that appear in the archaeological sites in the Cantabrian region. Furthermore, some of these varieties appear in very restricted geographical areas, and therefore, these can be used as territorial mobility markers. With all this information, a precise definition of mobility patterns of prehistoric groups (Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and recent prehistory even to protohistoric times) in the Cantabrian region is achievable.},

  abstract = {Scaled or splintered pieces are one of the most common lithic artifact type in Upper Paleolithic assemblages throughout Europe, especially in its westernmost regions. Despite this, and even after one century of being identified, there is still no consensus on how to define, analyze, or interpret these tools. In western Iberia, there is a clear lack of comprehensive studies regarding this type of artifacts at a regional scale. In this paper, we present a first techno-morphological analysis of a sample of scaled pieces from the Upper Paleolithic site of Vale Boi. Our first aim was to build upon existing analytical models in order to identify function and possible reduction strategies for these artifacts. Our second goal was to critically evaluate the role of these artifacts within western Iberia's Upper Paleolithic. Our results showed that functional identification of scaled pieces is still not clear. By comparing our data with other author's, we found that current models could not be applied to the archeological record, as the attribute variability is too high. Furthermore, in this region, we found that higher frequencies of bipolar technology can be found related to residential sites due to both functional and cultural patterns. While we still cannot define a specific function for these artifacts (intermediate pieces or wedges for working hard raw materials or cores for the extraction of chips and small bladelets), it is clear that they had a major role in the variability and intensification of resource exploitation during the Upper Paleolithic in western Iberia.},

Then, they were stored in a unsterile room under microclimatically unmanipulated fluctuating conditions, for lengths of time ranging from 7 years, 6 months to 10 years, 2 months. Afterwards, the bloodstains were coated with both carbon and gold and then examined by a JEOL JSM-6400 scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results revealed a time-independent preservation of erythrocyte integrity, displaying moon-like shapes, and negative replicas. These results agree with several previously reported SEM analyses of younger mammalian bloodstains on chert and materials other than obsidian and limestone, and lead to consider the moon-like shapes (hecatocytes, a term ex novo) and negative replicas (janocytes, another term ex novo) as the genuine RBC morphologies characteristic of (at least mammalian) bloodstains.},

Bromalite are a grouping of trace fossil related to feeding that include regurgitalites, consumulites and coprolites. It is important that coprolites be given binomial names (an ichnotaxonomy). The earliest probable vertebrate coprolites are Ordovician in age, but invertebrate coprolites date back to the Early Cambrian. Both vertebrates and invertebrates have important coprolite fossil records through the remainder of the Phanerozoic. The producers of a few distinct invertebrate coprolites can be recognized at the family level, but many cannot even be attributed to a Phylum. Vertebrate coprolites can usually be assigned to a producer at the ordinal level. Coprolites have diverse utility in invertebrate and vertebrate paleobiology and other fields of study.},

Despite validation studies that demonstrate the importance of sample preparation, data collection settings, and data processing, there remains no standard for how to report pXRF results. In this article, we address the need for best practices in publishing pXRF analyses. We outline information that should be published alongside interpretive results in any archaeological application of pXRF. By publishing this basic information, archaeologists will increase the transparency and replicability of their analyses on an inter-analyst/inter-analyzer basis and provide clarity for journal editors and peer reviewers on publications and grant proposals for studies that use pXRF. The use of these best practices will result in better science in the burgeoning use of pXRF in archaeology.},

The relations among tool roles, raw-material distribution, and mobility as well as the archaeological consequences of the different roles are key factors. An examination of temporal trends in the use of bifacial implements in the Carson Sink of western Nevada shows how the proposed perspective on lithic technology can help to elucidate change in mobility strategies. A shift from the use of bifaces as cores to an infrequent use of bifaces as tools suggests a shift from logistical to short-term residential use of the raw-material-poor Carson Sink; a later shift to the use of small, frequently unifacial, nonresharpenable points may indicate a shift to target-specific hunting strategies.},

  abstract = {The Gravettian is considered one of the first pan-European cultures of the Upper Paleolithic, spreading from Portugal to Russia between 28-20 000 years BP and characterised by backed blades and points. The Noaillian is a local variant in southern Europe (Northern Spain, Southern France and Italy). In France Noaillian is supposedly evolving into the Rayssian which is replaced later by recent Gravettian. By reconsidering the formation processes of some key stratigraphic sequences, the author demonstrates that the Rayssian is an idiosyncratic culture that does not have abrupt-backed bladelets, and that runs chronologically in parallel with the others. A case study, based on new work at the site of La Picardie (Indre-et-Loire), suggests that we should expect to defined different contemporary regional groups during this long period.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Fossilized faeces (bromalites) are common in the geological record and have been recognized for centuries, first for their peculiarity and later for sedimentological and palaeontological analysis. Coprolites (the ejected faecal material) and cololites (faecal material preserved in the gut) may be morphologically and compositionally similar and are dealt with in parataxonomic classification as trace fossils. While much effort has been put into the study of coprolites produced by vertebrates, invertebrate coprolites remain poorly understood and information about them is scattered. The last systematic overview of all invertebrate coprolite ichnotaxa known was compiled in Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology in 1975, but since then the number of ichnogenera has more than doubled and many taxonomic changes have been made. This revision provides an updated classification of invertebrate coprolites and cololites according to the taxonomic ranks of ichnofamilies (4), ichnogenera (36) and ichnospecies (141). The following new ichnotaxa and combinations are established: Bactrylliidae ifam. nov.; Tubulaspira igen. nov.; Cilindrotomaculum houi (Chen \& Erdtmann) comb. nov.; Coprulus paramolus (Bischoff) comb. nov.; Coptocampylodon gramanni (Gaillard) comb. nov.; Coptocampylodon hemistriatus (Gaillard) comb. nov.; Coptocampylodon porcaeformis (Bischoff) comb. nov.; Coptocampylodon partitus (Bischoff) comb. nov.; Isvilina cryptillus (Bischoff) comb. nov.; and Tubulaspira iecta (Schallreuter) comb. nov.},

  abstract = {It is widely believed that the design of transported artifacts and toolkits employed by mobile populations is influenced by two main factors, portability and potential utility. Choices about the kinds of artifacts to carry around can be modeled as an optimization problem, in which it is beneficial to obtain the greatest potential utility for the minimum total weight. This study approaches the problem analytically, making a few simple assumptions about artifact geometry and the relations between utility and artifact size. If artifact utility is calculated as a function of potential for renewal, transported toolkits should consist entirely of relatively small finished tools. Moreover, most gains in durability or multifunctionality that require increases in overall size are outweighed by increased transport cost. Inconsistencies between these expectations and ethnographic and archaeological observations point to situations in which artifact functionality is more closely constrained by overall size or mass.           ,              Resumen             Existe una creencia generalizada que sostiene que el dise{\~n}o de artefactos y conjuntos de herramientas transportados y empleados por poblaciones m{\'o}biles est{\'a} influenciado por dos factores principales, portabilidad y utilidad potencial. La selecci{\'o}n de las clases de artefactos que se transportan puede ser modelada como un problema de optimizaci{\'o}n, en el cual es provechoso obtener la mayor utilidad potencial por el menor peso total. Este estudio enfoca el problema analiticamente, y utiliza pocos supuestos simples sobre la geometr{\'i}a del artefacto y las relaciones entre utilidad y tama{\~n}o del artefacto.

The stratigraphic sequence documents some 12,000 years of the early Upper Paleolithic, entailing changes in lithic technology, raw material exploitation, and game use. Although the same lithic raw materials were exploited throughout the sequence to make quite similar ranges of products, there are marked changes in the ways raw materials from different source areas were treated, including patterns of transport and raw material consumption. The concept of technological provisioning is used to understand changing strategies for procuring and managing supplies of flint from different source locations. Shifts in raw material economy are argued to represent responses to changes in residential mobility and the scale/duration of occupations at the cave itself: data on cultural features and foraging strategies provide independent evidence for these shifts in land use. Results have implications for more nuanced approaches to investigating of lithic raw material economies and the significance of ``raw material transfers.''},

  abstract = {During the Neolithic, obsidians of the Monte Arci (Sardinia) volcanic complex were by far more used in the northern Tyrrhenian area than those of the three other source-islands (Lipari, Palmarola, Pantelleria) in the western Mediterranean. It is shown that merely determinations of content for six major elements with a scanning electron microscope by energy dispersion spectrometry (SEM-EDS) are sufficient to distinguish the four types of Monte Arci obsidians. Because of the compositional similarities between these obsidian types, a multivariate analysis is recommended in provenance studies. Although SEM-EDS, electron microprobe-wavelength dispersion spectrometry (EMP-WDS) and particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE) give essentially concordant results in the determination of these six element contents, subtle technique-related biases prevent the combination of SEM-EDS, EMP-WDS and PIXE data on source samples for provenance purposes. An SEM-EDS test-study reveals the first occurrence of obsidians of Lipari for the A Fuata Middle to Late Neolithic site of NW Corsica (north of Sardinia), in addition to the usual Monte Arci obsidians. Similar to EMP-WDS, the SEM-EDS technique requires only millimeter-sized fragments.},

This technology provides real-time or near real-time decision support for operational field decisions (exploration, mining, site remediation or waste management), provides a cost-saving alternative to classical laboratory analysis programs, and deals efficiently with remote or harsh field conditions. The ability to rapidly collect a large number of samples and replicate analyses facilitates acquisition of higher data density compatible with geostatistics. pXRF can be used profitably for sample screening and selection tasks, dynamic sampling plans based on field observations and measurements, grid mapping of a site and determining relative element abundance. In waste management and remediation, pXRF is used to identify unknown waste composition, and verify waste loads before disposal or treatment. In all applications, having robust QA/QC plans and systematic laboratory controls on selected samples are essential for ensuring reliable measurements. The best overall results are usually achieved through a clever combination of field (pXRF) and lab data, with pXRF providing the bulk of the data at low cost, on larger data sets and potentially with better reliability than lab-based campaigns based on a limited number of samples.},

  abstract = {Understanding mobility and landscape use is important in reconstructing subsistence behavior, range, and group size, and it may contribute to our understanding of phenomena such as the dynamics of biological and cultural interactions between distinct populations of Upper Pleistocene humans. However, studies using traditional strontium isotope analysis are generally limited to identifying locations of childhood residence or nonlocal individuals and lack the sampling resolution to detect movement over short timescales. Here, using an optimized methodology, we present highly spatially resolved               87               Sr/               86               Sr measurements made by laser ablation multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry along the growth axis of the enamel of two marine isotope stage 5b, Middle Paleolithic Neanderthal teeth (Gruta da Oliveira), a Tardiglacial, Late Magdalenian human tooth (Galeria da Cisterna), and associated contemporaneous fauna from the Almonda karst system, Torres Novas, Portugal. Strontium isotope mapping of the region shows extreme variation in               87               Sr/               86               Sr, with values ranging from 0.7080 to 0.7160 over a distance of c. 50~km, allowing short-distance (and arguably short-duration) movement to be detected. We find that the early Middle Paleolithic individuals roamed across a subsistence territory of approximately 600~km               2               , while the Late Magdalenian individual parsimoniously fits a pattern of limited, probably seasonal movement along the right bank of the 20-km-long Almonda River valley, between mouth and spring, exploiting a smaller territory of approximately 300~km               2               . We argue that the differences in territory size are due to an increase in population density during the Late Upper Paleolithic.},

  abstract = {For at least 2.5 million years, humans have been using tools, and until just a few thousand years ago their most important tools were of stone. The single most important and widely used stone in nearly every part of the world was chert, also known as flint. It was widely available, easily worked, and capable of being broken in a controlled manner to create sharp and durable edges. Artifacts of chert excavated in an archaeological context are invaluable to archaeologists; they are often the only surviving source of information about prehistoric cultures.This useful reference synthesizes the available information on chert and its properties, examining its origins, chemical composition, appearance, mechanical attributes and variations in order to better understand the ancient people who used the material to such great advantage.},

  abstract = {In the modern oceans, the removal of dissolved silica from sea water is principally a biological process carried out by diatoms, with lesser contributions from  radiolaria, silicoflagellates, and sponges.  Because such silica in sediments is often redistributed locally during diagenesis to from nodular or bedded chert, stratigraphic changes in the facies distribution of early diagenetic chert provide important insights into the development of biological participation in the silica cycle.  The abundance of chert in upper Proterozoic peritidal carbonates suggests that at this time silica was removed from seawater principally by abiological processes operating in part of the margins of the oceans.  With the evolution of demosponges near the beginning of the Cambrian Period, subtidal biogenetic cherts became increasingly common, and with the Ordovician rise of radiolaria to ecological and biogeochemical prominence, sedimented skeletons became a principal sink for oceanic silica.  Cherts of Silurian to Cretaceous age share many features of facies distribution and petrography but they differ from Cenozoic siliceous deposits.  These differences are interpreted to reflect the mid-Cretaceous radiation of diatoms and their subsequent rise to domination of the silica cycle.  Biogeochemical cycles provide an important framework for the paleobiological interpretation of the organisms that participate in them.},

Cluster and factorial statistical analyses were performed to establish the relationship between samples. The main conclusions extracted are as follows: (1) The mobility of the inhabitants of Los Canes cave may have been very restricted, and they used local raw materials. (2) The inhabitants of Los Canes cave used chert preferentially in the elaboration of different typologies. (3) The mineralogical and elemental compositions of the chert samples from Level 6 of Los Canes cave and those from nearby outcrops are similar. (4) The crystallite size values of the tool cherts ({$>$}1000 {\AA}) and the almost complete absence of moganite and chalcedony indicate a high degree of maturity and could belong to the Carboniferous, the period to which the cherts of the outcrops used for comparison also belong.},

This limits the progress of archaeology because researchers cannot easily reproduce each other's work to verify or extend it. Four general principles of reproducible research that have emerged in other fields are presented. An archaeological case study is described that shows how each principle can be implemented using freely available software. The costs and benefits of implementing reproducible research are assessed. The primary benefit, of sharing data in particular, is increased impact via an increased number of citations. The primary cost is the additional time required to enhance reproducibility, although the exact amount is difficult to quantify.},

We investigate how the structure and tooling of software packages of the R programming language are being used to produce research compendia in a variety of disciplines.

  abstract = {Neanderthals lived in Eurasia alongside anatomically modern humans (AMHs) until some 40,000\,years ago. The extinction of Neanderthals is attributed to either climatic change, or to the effect of competition with AMHs. We used fossil occurrence records and paleoclimatic data to model the potential distributions of H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis using Species Distribution Models, and calculated the degree of habitat quality and connectivity at successive time steps. We found that both species potential geographic ranges progressively retreated from their northeastern borders beginning with 44\,ka. Although the degree of habitat loss is similar for the two species, the potential range for H. sapiens was constantly some 50\% larger on average. The degree of habitat fragmentation, and the size, number, and average distance between optimal habitat patches was initially very similar for the two species. However, all these landscape metrics showed a progressive deterioration for H. neanderthalensis only over time. At the end of their existence, the most suitable habitat patches for Neanderthals were small and isolated, and their inferred climatic niche width was statistically narrower than in H. sapiens. This does not mean that climate worsening drove Neanderthals extinct, yet it suggests extinction risk for the latter markedly increased over time, towards its actual extinction date.},

On this island,there are some prehistoric settlements, dated from the Neolithic to theMiddle Bronze Age (6000- 1200 BC), in which the use of obsidian continueduntil the beginning of metals age. Our study includes: i) Macroscopic andmicroscopic optical observations, which allowed selecting 18 obsidianflakes (starting from 50 obsidian flakes) on the base of their morphologicalcharacteristics. ii) Density measurements (hydrostatic balance). iii)Scanning electron microscope determination (SEM-EDS) of major elementsof the obsidian glasses and minerals.Results of our analyses were compared with 12 geological samplescollected in obsidian sources from Monte Arci (Sardinia), Palmarola,Lipari and Pantelleria, i.e. the four most exploited obsidian sources of theancient world in the Western-Central Mediterranean. This study confirmsthe presence of the Lipari and Pantelleria sources (Sicily) in our obsidianset. iv) We also determined (by FT-IR) the hydration degree of someobsidian flakes in order to detect a possible hydration gradient between therim and the core of the flake sample. The width of the hydration rim, if any,can be used for an approximate evaluation of the age of the tool.},

  abstract = {In western Europe, the Middle to Upper Paleolithic (M/UP) transition, dated between {$\approx$}35,000 and {$\approx$}40,000 radiocarbon years, corresponded to a period of major human biological and cultural changes. However, information on human population densities is scarce for that period. New faunal data from the high-resolution record of Saint-C{\'e}saire, France, indicate an episode of significant climatic deterioration during the early Upper Paleolithic (EUP), which also was associated with a reduction in mammalian species diversity. High correlations between ethnographic data and mammalian species diversity suggest that this shift decreased human population densities. Reliance on reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), a highly fluctuating resource, would also have promoted declines in human population densities. These data suggest that the EUP represented for humans a period of significant niche contraction in western Europe. In this context, the possibility that a modern human expansion occurred in this region seems low. Instead, it is suggested that population bottlenecks, genetic drift, and gene flow prevailed over human population replacement as mechanisms of evolution in humans during the EUP.},

This assertion contradicts much of the current thinking about mobility and the organization of lithic technology and is at odds with the archaeological record. A flaw in Kuhn's equation for calculating the utility/mass ratio of retouched tools leads him to this erroneous conclusion. Problems with Kuhn's utility/mass ratio equation are described and an alternative formula is offered. The corrected formula indicates that larger stone tools maximize utility at a lower transport cost. Experimental evidence for additional advantages of larger stone tools is also provided.           ,              Kuhn (1994) arguye que los artefactos liticos peque{\~n}os son un medio optimo para reducir el peso de los conjuntos liticos de grupos moviles, al mismo tiempo que maximizan la utilidad potencial. Esta afirmaci{\'o}n contradice mucho de lo que conocemos actualmente sobre movilidady organizaci{\'o}n de tecnologia litica, y no esta de acuerdo con el registro arqueol{\'o}gico. Una falla en la ecuaci{\'o}n que Kuhn utiliza para calcular la proporci{\'o}n utilidad/masa en artefactos retocados lo ha conducido a esas conclusiones equivocadas. En este articulo se describen los problemas de la ecuaci{\'o}n utilidad/masa de Kuhn y se ofrece una formula alternativa. La ecuaci{\'o}n correcta indica que los artefactos de piedra grandes, con una alta capacidad de reavivamiento, maximizan la utilidad con bajos costos de transporte.

  abstract = {Many chert sequences are located at key stratigraphic intervals or in structurally allochthonous packages, and because such sequences provide critical information regarding the formation of sedimentary basins and tectonic orogens it is important to determine precisely their original depositional position. Chemical methods of delineating environments are becoming increasingly sophisticated and useful, in part because even slight post-depositional recrystallization may obscure primary rock textures. Most chemical criteria have developed only on a case-by-case and local basis, however, with limited broad applicability. Here I synthesize major, trace, and rare earth element (REE) data in bulk chert from 49 sequences from continental margin, pelagic, and ridge-proximal environments, ranging in age from Early Paleozoic to Neogene, and develop a set of depositional chemical criteria applicable to cherts regardless of age, diagenetic history, or tectonic region. The criteria allow for analytical limitations and diagenetic modifications (precluding use of Si, Ca, Mn, Mg, P, Sr, and Ba, and other elements) intrinsic to chert chemistry. Major element ratios, capitalizing on the affiliations of Al2O3 and TiO2 to terrigenous matter and of Fe2O3 to metalliferous input, can distinguish continental margin from ridge-proximal sedimentation, but cannot uniquely identify pelagic deposition. Trace element data are too few to interpret rigorously, with substantial overlap occurring between depositional regimes. REE ratios (i.e., Lan/ Cen) allow the best resolution of all three depositional regimes and are independent of diagenetic modification. I present new diagrams illustrating the chemical depositional criteria, and apply them to several sequences described in the literature that have historically yielded problematic genetic interpretations.},

Changes between wet/cold and dry/cool conditions in the Iberian Peninsula detected during these extreme events cannot be explained by a simple oceanographic mechanism related to changes in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Here we propose an additional atmospheric mechanism able to produce this scenario based on the comparison between the MD99-2331 record and other available palaeoclimate sequences from the North Atlantic region (18--75{$^\circ$}N and 0--75{$^\circ$}W). The climatic asymmetry observed between mid- and subtropical eastern North Atlantic latitudes (wet/dry) and the Blake Outer Ridge (dry/wet) during H4, H2 and H1 can be explained by changes in the position of the Atlantic jet-stream. During the first phase of H4, H2 and H1 the Atlantic jet-stream was located further south following the southward displacement of the oceanic thermal front as far south as 35{$^\circ$}--37{$^\circ$}N. On the contrary, during the second phase of H4, H2 and H1 the jet-stream was located further north following the northward displacement of this thermal front as far north as 42{$^\circ$}N. From the atmospheric point of view, these two phases are reminiscent of the present-day negative and positive prevailing modes of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), respectively, but high-resolution studies of additional North Atlantic key sites and climate simulations are needed to confirm the hypothesis of a NAO-like mechanism operating on millennial timescales.},

  abstract = {Although it is now commonplace for archaeologists to study use-alteration patterns on ceramics, the same cannot be said of one of the most ubiquitous classes of hunter-gatherer artifacts, fire-cracked rocks (FCR). It can be shown, however, that many of the same methods and theories applied to the study of cooking ceramics are also relevant to the investigation of rocks used as heating elements. Because use alteration analyses of FCR are so scarce, I describe a range of attributes with the goal of helping researchers identify use alterations (e.g., sooting, reddening, various fracturing patterns) on lithic artifacts from sites worldwide and evaluate their potential function in various cultural practices. These attributes are also outlined in order to create a standardized terminology for describing FCR use-alteration patterns. I discuss my analysis of FCR from three Late Archaic sites (Duck Lake, 913, and 914) on Grand Island in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, followed by an interpretation of their cooking contexts, as a case study. The results indicate great intersite variability among FCR characteristics, cooking methods, and cooking facilities (earth oven, stone boiling, and rock griddle). This use alteration analysis can be applied in archaeological contexts worldwide where similar materials are recovered., Aunque hoy en d{\'i}a es com{\'u}n estudiar los patrones de alteraci{\'o}n causada por el uso en la cer{\'a}mica, no se puede decir lo mismo para una de las clases m{\'a}s ubicuas de artefactos producidos por grupos cazadores-recolectores, las rocas agrietadas por el fuego (FCR, por sus siglas en ingl{\'e}s). Sin embargo, se puede demostrar que muchos de los m{\'e}todos y teor{\'i}as aplicados al estudio de la cer{\'a}mica para cocinar tambi{\'e}n son relevantes para la investigaci{\'o}n de las rocas utilizadas como elementos para calentar. Debido a que los an{\'a}lisis de alteraci{\'o}n por uso de las FCR son escasos, se describe una gama de atributos para auxiliar con la identificaci{\'o}n de alteraciones causadas por el uso (e.g., holl{\'i}n, enrojecimiento, diversos patrones de fracturamiento) en artefactos l{\'i}ticos de sitios de todo el mundo, y para evaluar sus potenciales funciones en diversas pr{\'a}cticas culturales. Tambi{\'e}n se esbozan estos atributos con el objetivo de establecer una terminolog{\'i}a estandarizada para describir los patrones de alteraci{\'o}n por uso de las FCR. Como estudio de caso se presenta el an{\'a}lisis de FCR procedentes de tres sitios del Arcaico Tard{\'i}o (Duck Lake, 913 y 914) en Grand Island, en la pen{\'i}nsula superior de Michigan, seguido de la interpretaci{\'o}n de sus contextos de cocina. Los resultados indican una gran variabilidad entre sitios en las caracter{\'i}sticas de las FCR, los m{\'e}todos y las instalaciones de cocci{\'o}n (horno de tierra, sancocho de piedras y parrilla de piedra). Este an{\'a}lisis de alteraci{\'o}n por uso puede aplicarse en contextos arqueol{\'o}gicos de todo el mundo donde se presentan materiales similares.},

For example, sourcing studies using pXRF have irradiated artifacts and geologic source materials for widely varying amounts of time. In this study, we investigate the effect of count time on the precision and accuracy of pXRF data obtained for two geologic standards, as well as for obsidian, fine-grained volcanic (e.g., andesites, dacites), metamorphic, and chert specimens from the North American Great Basin. We find that the precision and reliability of pXRF data does not improve significantly at count times greater than 180 s. Our analysis also indicates that count time has little bearing on the accuracy or validity of pXRF data, as expected from the mathematical relationships between count time, intensity, and concentration. Finally, we demonstrate that a well-calibrated pXRF instrument generates compositional data comparable to data obtained using other analytical methods. We offer this study as a step toward the development of a consistent and rigorous analytical protocol for archeological applications of pXRF.},

It is bounded to the north by the Beja-Acebuches Ophiolitic Complex and related accretionary wedge. To the south lie the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) and flysch deposits forming the southern extent of the zone. Structural analysis within the Spanish side of the SPZ supports continuous south propagating deformation, evolving from early synmetamorphic thrusting in the internal zone to thin-skinned tectonics in the southern external domain. The accretion of the SPZ to the Ossa Morena Zone is also witnessed by the presence of various m{\'e}langes, observed throughout the investigated area. Part of the m{\'e}langes observed in the IPB are related to the volcanics and mineralizations setting. A key point to understand the IPB mineralizations genesis is to constrain the volcanogenic model. One underestimated feature is the large amount of submarine calc-alkaline ignimbritic facies, implying the presence of caldera structures within the province. Such correlation between caldera environment and ore deposits strongly suggests that the IPB developed in a continental arc. Our geodynamic model proposes an early north directed subduction associated with the obduction of the oceanic crust toward the south. Southward, this episode is immediately followed by the development of the accretionary prism, while farther south, a second subduction zone responsible for the arc setting of the IPB initiates. Subsequent Visean continental collision is associated with the deposit of the south propagating flysch and the present geometry of the SPZ.},

While some argue that these differences were a progressive phenomenon that started with the shift from the Pleistocene to the Holocene, others defend that the Late Pleistocene patterns were fairly similar to those of the Epipaleolithic and that the major shift was rapid, dramatic and triggered by the necessary adaptation to the 8.2 ka cal BP (8.09e8.25 ka cal BP) climatic event. The study of lithic raw material provenance might be useful for this discussion, since it has been suggested that the Magdalenian and Epipaleolithic populations from this region were collecting this resources within a close range territory, whereas the Mesolithic populations were acquiring them at longer distances.},

Procurement of raw material, specifically flint, has allowed the tracing of the mobility of both stones and people, as well as selective processes to obtain specific types or even extraction activities. The analysis of quartzite has also developed in recent years, providing an opportunity to better understand prehistoric societies. This study characterizes the procurement strategies implemented by Middle Paleolithic people in the mountainous region of the Picos de Europa. To this end, we present a comprehensive characterization of potential catchment areas: massive outcrops, conglomerates, and river deposits. The exploitation of quartzite at the sites of El Habario and El Arteu allows us to understand the territorial management of this mountainous area through the combination of selective processes and mobility mechanisms in lower and middle altitudes. These perspectives enable us to view the mountainous region not as a barrier but as an environmental mosaic managed by Middle Paleolithic groups. This study shows strategies that bring together direct and embedded procurement based on both intensive and extensive searches. These discourses are more closely related to the daily life of people than those only considering the mobility of people and objects.},

  abstract = {The present work represents the first attempt using an archaeometric approach to characterize the potential chert outcrops and retrace the provenance of the chert raw materials in the Mesolithic and Neolithic contexts of the Eastern Iberia central site of Cueva de la Cocina (Dos Aguas, Valencia). Therefore, a research project aimed at identifying and characterizing potential sources in the surroundings of the site was carried out, as a first step, to test some hypotheses related to raw material provenance. Elemental profiles of several archaeological artifacts and of geological samples collected in different local and nonlocal outcrops were obtained using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. These chemical data were processed using multivariate statistics to investigate the possible links between the outcrops and archaeological artifacts. Preliminary results point to the use of local raw materials and also the presence of rocks outcropping in a perimeter of more than 50 km around Cueva de la Cocina, opening a new window to investigate the socioecological dynamics of the last hunter-gatherer and the first farmer inhabitants from a diachronic point of view in this region.},

  abstract = {If radiocarbon measurements are to be used at all for chronological purposes, we have to use statistical methods for calibration. The most widely used method of calibration can be seen as a simple application of Bayesian statistics, which uses both the information from the new measurement and information from the 14C calibration curve. In most dating applications, however, we have larger numbers of 14C measurements and we wish to relate those to events in the past. Bayesian statistics provides a coherent framework in which such analysis can be performed and is becoming a core element in many 14C dating projects. This article gives an overview of the main model components used in chronological analysis, their mathematical formulation, and examples of how such analyses can be performed using the latest version of the OxCal software (v4). Many such models can be put together, in a modular fashion, from simple elements, with defined constraints and groupings. In other cases, the commonly used ``uniform phase'' models might not be appropriate, and ramped, exponential, or normal distributions of events might be more useful. When considering analyses of these kinds, it is useful to be able run simulations on synthetic data. Methods for performing such tests are discussed here along with other methods of diagnosing possible problems with statistical models of this kind.},

  abstract = {Radiocarbon (14C) ages cannot provide absolutely dated chronologies for archaeological or paleoenvironmental studies directly but must be converted to calendar age equivalents using a calibration curve compensating for fluctuations in atmospheric 14C concentration. Although calibration curves are constructed from independently dated archives, they invariably require revision as new data become available and our understanding of the Earth system improves. In this volume the international 14C calibration curves for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, as well as for the ocean surface layer, have been updated to include a wealth of new data and extended to 55,000 cal BP. Based on tree rings, IntCal20 now extends as a fully atmospheric record to ca. 13,900 cal BP. For the older part of the timescale, IntCal20 comprises statistically integrated evidence from floating tree-ring chronologies, lacustrine and marine sediments, speleothems, and corals. We utilized improved evaluation of the timescales and location variable 14C offsets from the atmosphere (reservoir age, dead carbon fraction) for each dataset. New statistical methods have refined the structure of the calibration curves while maintaining a robust treatment of uncertainties in the 14C ages, the calendar ages and other corrections. The inclusion of modeled marine reservoir ages derived from a three-dimensional ocean circulation model has allowed us to apply more appropriate reservoir corrections to the marine 14C data rather than the previous use of constant regional offsets from the atmosphere. Here we provide an overview of the new and revised datasets and the associated methods used for the construction of the IntCal20 curve and explore potential regional offsets for tree-ring data. We discuss the main differences with respect to the previous calibration curve, IntCal13, and some of the implications for archaeology and geosciences ranging from the recent past to the time of the extinction of the Neanderthals.},

  abstract = {Based on the development of very specific lithic tools and the use of flat and covering retouch, the Solutrean has traditionally been envisioned as a unified cultural complex, representing a clear break from the preceding Gravettian technologies. As a consequence, migratory episodes have been proposed to explain the appearance of the particular characteristics of Solutrean lithic points. Here we present an assemblage with Vale Comprido points discovered at Marseillon in south-western France. The lithic industry is consistent with the definition of the Protosolutrean in Portugal, an industry in an intermediate stratigraphic position between the Late Gravettian and the Solutrean. Its description is followed by a discussion on the formation of the Solutrean and on the articulation between the Protosolutrean with Vale Comprido points and the classic Lower Solutrean with pointes a` face plane. According to this evidence, the Solutrean would have emerged from industries having strong typological and technological analogies over its entire zone of distribution.},

  abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is a vital nutrient for the ecosystems and its excess in wastewater streams leads to some environmental issues such as extensive algae growth (eutrophication). Phytoremediation is a green technology that is based on the combined actions of plants and their associated microbial groups to remove and transfer the toxic compounds in surface water, groundwater and soil. Aquatic plants are widely used for the remediation of contaminated rivers, eutrophic lakes, and other water bodies. In the past three decades, free-floating, submerged, emergent macrophytes and microalgae species have been used for P removal in aquatic plant-based systems such as constructed wetlands (CWs). This paper reviews the recent studies on the potential of aquatic plants such as free-floating, submerged, and emergent plants, and also microalgae for removal of P in different types of wastewaters. Several parameters such as plant species, hydraulic retention time, temperature, type of CWs, effluent concentration, and seasonal changes have effects on P removal. Based on the findings, some of the species such as Azolla and water hyacinth had the highest uptake ability up to 90\% while algae species such as Chlorella showed about 70\% of P removal. In addition, the mixed culture of aquatic plants can increase P removal if the interaction of the species is considered before cultivation in CWs.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new methodology to study prehistoric lithic assemblages in an attempt to derive from that facet of prehistoric behavior the greater technoeconomic system in which it was embedded. By using volumetric artifact density and the frequency of retouched pieces within a given lithic assemblage, it becomes possible to identify whether these stone tools were created by residentially mobile or logistically organized foragers. The linking factor between assemblage composition and land-use strategy is that of curation within lithic assemblages as an expression of economizing behavior. This method is used to study eight sites from southeastern Italy to detect changes in adaptation during the Late Pleistocene. We compare and contrast Mousterian, Uluzzian, proto-Aurignacian and Epigravettian assemblages, and argue that the first three industries overlap considerably in terms of their technoeconomic flexibility. Epigravettian assemblages, on the other hand, display a different kind of land-use exploitation pattern than those seen in the earlier assemblages, perhaps as a response to deteriorating climatic conditions at the Last Glacial Maximum. While we discuss the implications of these patterns in the context of modern human origins, we argue that the methodology can help identify land-use patterns in other locales and periods.           ,              Resumen             Nous proposons une nouvelle approche pour l'{\'e}tude des ensembles lithiques permettant d'identifier les syst{\`e}mes techno-{\'e}conomiques dans lesquels ils s'ins{\`e}rent. Utilisant comme param{\`e}tres analytiques la densit{\'e} volum{\'e}trique d'art{\`e}facts et le rapport outils/d{\'e}bitage, il devient possible d'attribuer un ensemble lithique pr{\'e}historique {\`a} un mode d'organisation << logistique >> ou << {\`a} mobilit{\'e} r{\'e}sidentielle >>.

Drawing on the realization that human niche construction can be documented in the pre-agricultural archaeological record, niche construction theory is used as a conceptual framework to tie together facets of the behavioral, biological, and ecological dimensions of the transition interval into formal models of their interaction over time and in diverse contexts. Ultimately, this effort shows how foragers of the transitional interval in the Italian peninsula were active agents in shaping their evolutionary history, with consequences of some adaptive systems being felt only much later and directing the forces responsible for the ultimate disappearance of the Mousterian and Uluzzian technocomplexes in favor of the proto-Aurignacian industry, the exact nature of which clearly appears to vary on a regional level.},

  abstract = {The forests in the Iberian Peninsula have been strongly influenced by past climatic changes, but reconstructing their historical distributions and dynamics is very difficult due to the complex climatic characteristics and relief of the region. Research disciplines such as phylogeography and species distribution modelling can describe the past range dynamics of individual tree species in relatively great detail and help elucidate how these species have reacted to climatic changes. Here we review phylogeographical and modelling studies from species representative of the major Iberian forest types and attempt to extract general trends from the diversity of individual species histories in the Peninsula. To date most studies focus on geographical range dynamics during the Pleistocene, but an increasing body of evidence shows that some species have also retained the genetic imprints of much more ancient processes. Many widespread Iberian species show a deep and often remarkably clear-cut divide between populations from the Mediterranean and from the Atlantic regions of the Iberian Peninsula, suggesting that both areas have independently sustained viable populations over extended periods. In fact, phylogeographical studies commonly find that species had several glacial refugia across the Iberian Peninsula. On the other hand, distribution models help identifying further suitable areas that could have sustained so far undetected refugia. Such studies are of interest for species conservation, because refugium populations are high-priority targets due to their longterm persistence and unique evolutionary trajectory. Overall, we conclude that palaeoecology, phylogeography and species distribution modelling have a great potential to inform each other because of their complementary perspectives and results. A true integration of these approaches is therefore fundamental for further progress in our understanding of past Iberian environments and the organisms they harboured.},

The onset of these oscilla-tions was abrupt, with most of the change in climate accomplished within 10--200 years (Steffensen et al., 2008) and the magnitude of the change was large (of the order of 8--15 C in Greenland) (Huber et al., 2006). Two types of rapid climate changes have been described: Dansgaard--Oeschger (D-O) cycles (Dansgaard et al.,1984), associated with abrupt warming and subsequent cooling in Greenland, and cold phases associated with the formation of ice-rafted debris (IRD) deposits (Heinrich layers) (Heinrich, 1988) in the North Atlantic. Dansgaard--Oeschger cycles are clearly registered in the Greenland ice-core record (e.g. Johnsen et al., 1992; North GRIP Members, 2004) and the traces of both of these climate oscillations are recorded in a variety of marine and terrestrial records worldwide (e.g. Bond et al., 1993; Allen et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2001; Gonzalez et al., 2008). The geographic pattern of registration of individual oscillations (Sanchez Go{\~n} i et al., 2008), and the magnitude, nature and length of the component phases of each recorded oscillation, appear to vary (Johnsen et al., 1992). However, documentation of regional changes has been hampered by problems of the synchronisation of individual chronologies, and our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these climate oscillations is still far from complete. Analysis of the mechanisms and impacts of large and rapid climate changes in the past is given additional impetus by the possibility that such events might occur in the future. Although the precise causes are different, investigation of the impact of the warming events at the beginning of D-O cycles or of iceberg melting during Heinrich intervals on the Meridional Overturning Circula-tion (MOC) in the North Atlantic speaks directly to the impact of future changes in the MOC on regional climate. Coupled ocean-- atmosphere model simulations show a reduction of the MOC during the 21st century, in some cases by up to 50\%, as a conse-quence of greenhouse-gas-induced polar warming (Gregory et al., 2005). Simulations with simpler climate models have shown that complete shutdown of the MOC can occur if the slowdown reaches a crucial threshold (which differs in different models) (Stocker and Schmittner, 1997; Stouffer and Manabe, 2003; Stouffer et al., 2006). Clearly, the coupled models do not reach the critical threshold as a result of the gradual change in greenhouse-gas forcing during the 21st century but might do so if the additional forcing due to even partial melting of the Greenland ice sheet were taken into account. There have been several recent attempts to synthesise millen-nial-scale climate change during the glacial (e.g. Broecker and Hemming, 2001; Alley et al., 2002; van Andel, 2002; Voelker, 2002), but most focus on marine and ice-core records. In this issue, we focus on documenting regional changes in vegetation indicated by pollen records from both marine and terrestrial cores (Fletcher et al., in this issue; Takahara et al., in this issue; Jim{\'e} nez-Moreno et al., in this issue; He{\ss}ler et al., in this issue). There are multiple reasons why this is timely. First, there has been a very rapid increase during the last decade in the number of pollen records with high temporal resolution. However, there is no global compi-lation of the pollen data, nor a synthesis of vegetation reconstruc-tions based on these data. Second, the development of a new and coherent ice-core reference chronology (GICC05: Svensson et al., 2006, 2008; see also Wolff et al., in this issue) makes it possible to achieve a better synchronisation between documented changes in Greenland and the pollen records. Third, a regional synthesis of charcoal records from North America (Marlon et al., 2009) shows that fire regimes respond to abrupt climate changes during the last deglaciation -- but little is known about the response of fire globally to millennial-scale climate variability and associated vege-tation changes during earlier intervals (Daniau et al., in this issue). Fourth, investigation of the impact of changes in vegetation cover, including wetland extent, and in fire regimes is important for understanding the rapid and extremely large (up to ca 200 ppb) changes in methane during D-O cycles (Blunier and Brook, 2001; Fl{\"u} ckiger et al., 2004) and the potential climate feedback. Finally, modelling groups have recently begun to explore the impact of, e.g., changes in freshwater forcing under glacial conditions on regional climates (e.g. Crucifix et al., 2001; Ganopolski and Rahm-storf, 2001; Claussen et al., 2003; Knutti et al., 2004; Fl{\"u} ckiger et al., 2006, 2008; see also Kageyama et al., in this issue) but more detailed documentation of observed changes is required for the evaluation of these experiments. A multiplicity of terms is used in discussing rapid climate changes and millennial-scale climate variability during the glacial, and this has led to some confusion particularly in relating records from different regions. Alley et al. (2002), in a definition adopted by the IPCC (Meehl et al., 2007), define abrupt climate change as one that takes place more rapidly than the underlying forcing, pointing out that this kind of behaviour can only occur when the climate system crosses a critical threshold defining the limit between two different climate states. This definition provides a theoretical basis for understanding abrupt climate changes (e.g. Kageyama et al., in this issue) but the rapidity of the climate change},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present the first results obtained after new fieldwork and laboratory studies of chert catchment sources during the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic in inland Iberia, a region that has been traditionally depicted as marginal and sparsely populated during the last glacial due to its harsh ecological conditions compared to the coastal areas of the Iberian Peninsula. Our main aim is to determine the mobility strategies and social networks of the last Neandertals and first modern humans settled in inland Iberia and neighbouring regions, and eventually test the hypothesis that the last glacial human settlement in the Iberian hinterland was more dense and complex than previously thought. In this study, we focus on the cherts exploited at two archaeological sites: the Pe{\~n}a Cabra and Pe{\~n}a Cap{\'o}n rock shelters. These sites are located in the southeastern foothills of the Central System range, in the province of Guadalajara (Spain), and they have yielded a sequence of human occupations from the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic, respectively. To obtain a detailed picture of the mobility patterns and catchment strategies of the huntergatherers settled at these sites, our fieldwork focussed on identifying chert outcrops that could have been frequented and exploited by them. After two field seasons, 22 chert outcrops from eight geological formations were identified and more than 300 samples were collected and analysed. We conducted textural, micropalaeontological, petrographical and geochemical analyses, with the aim of comprehensively characterising the various rock resources available in the study area. Results have shown that different siliceous varieties were available in the area surrounding the sites and both Neandertals and modern humans could have provisioned there. Also, they suggest the potential existence of a network connecting the Tagus and Ebro valleys, but this is a working hypothesis to be tested with future research.},

These findings require archaeometric techniques and methods for detecting the heat-induced effects within lithic artefacts. However, the existing methods are often cost-intensive and time-consuming, and most of them are destructive. Here, we present a new method using the infrared spectroscopic measurement of the strength of H-bonds formed between surface silanole groups (SiOH) and H2O molecules held in open pores of the samples. The reduction of H-bond strength in chalcedony is shown to be strongly correlated with the loss of open pores induced by heat treatment. Hence, the method is based on measuring one of the transformations aimed for by the instigators of the heat treatment: the reduction of porosity that modifies the rock's mechanical properties. A first application to heat-treated material from the Neolithic Chassey culture (southern France) shows that flint was heated to temperatures between 200{$^\circ$}C and 250{$^\circ$}C in this period. This has important implications for the study of the procedures used and the heating environments. Our new method is non-destructive, rapid, cost-effective and allows for detection of the used annealing temperatures.},

With focus on the archaeological record, this paper examines to what extent diachronic variations in site density on the Iberian Peninsula are related to climate variability and cultural change. Studies are based on a comprehensive record of technocomplexes that date from the late Middle Palaeolithic, early Upper Palaeolithic, Gravettian and Solutrean. The record comprises altogether 152 archaeological cave sites and rock shelters. Analysis reveals strong regional differences between Northern and Southern Iberia, both in isochronic and in diachronic perspective. This is expressed by the strongly different patterns of human presence in these regions. In particular, within both regions major cultural changes coincide with the environmental impact of North Atlantic Heinrich Events (HE). From previous studies, it is known that the human population on the Iberian Peninsula (IP) must have suffered strongly under the extremely variable climate conditions during the Late Pleistocene. Based on extensive site-mapping, the hypothesis is that during HE a major disintegration of habitats must have occurred, with various but strongly isolated patchy refugia remaining. Further, during HE, Southern Iberia could not uphold its previous function in providing a reliable refuge for humans. Not only does climatic deterioration during the different HE repeatedly lead to a near-complete breakdown of settlement patterns, but following each HE there is a major reorganization in settlement patterns on the IP.},

In the Middle Palaeolithic of western Europe, raw material circulations seemed limited to a hundred of kilometres. This paper focuses on the circulation of flints on more than 250 km (minimal distances) in the Mousterian site of Champ Grand, France. Real distances are longer than 400 km. Modalities of circulation are exposed. The analyses of these products demonstrate an important anticipation concerning the mobile raw materials' management. These data demonstrate that this Mousterian site is a point in a complex and ramified settlement of the landscape. Diachronic relations with behavioural aspects of Upper Palaeolithic societies are exposed. To cite this article: L. Slimak, Y. Giraud, C. R. Palevol 6 (2007).},

The localized "Solutrean" phenomenon is seen as an indication of the existence of a human refugium in the favored environments of southwestern Europe, while the "Magdalenian" is interpreted as evidence of a biogeographical rebound on the part of hunter-gatherer populations under less severe Tardiglacial conditions in western Europe. The general model is one which seeks to explore the effects of range contraction and reexpansion upon the complex of human adaptive strategies.},

New chronological information points to roughly simultaneous appearance of certain Upper Paleolithic technological traits in both SE and SW Europe, while growing evidence suggests a significant degree of biological and cultural continuity between the Middle and Upper Paleolithic. On the other hand, there is considerable evidence that evolution continued to operate in both domains throughout the course of the late Upper Pleistocene, apparently in adaptive relationship to the major environmental changes of the Upper Pleniglacial and Tardiglacial. Spectacular developments in the realms of art and ideology may be understood in the special biogeographical, social, and economic conditions of Europe at the height of the Last Ice Age; both ended rather abruptly with the onset of the Holocene as the landscapes of Europe underwent pervasive upheavals.},

In addition to diversifying their subsistence base wherever and whenever possible, Upper Paleolithic hunters made efficient use of landforms and developed new types of weapon-delivery systems to procure large numbers of herd game. In so doing, they seem to have preferentially chosen to inhabit regions with significant hills and valleys. This allowed them to channel game movements and to hinder or trap herds, thereby facilitating mass kills. Specific physical features (rivers, cliffs, gorges, box canyons, blind valleys, etc.) were of proven use especially to late Upper Paleolithic hunters in their planned, scheduled mass kills of such species as horse, reindeer, red deer, bison, and ibex. The most dynamic component of Upper Paleolithic technologies was weaponry. New types of weapon tips, shafts, hafts, and propulsion devices were developed at an everaccelerating rate throughout the Upper Paleolithic and into the Mesolithic, between at least 35,000--40,000 BP and ca. 7000 BP.},

  abstract = {Geochemical, sedimentological and mineralogical features of 3.0 Ga Archean cherts and intercalated BIFs from the Pilbara Block, Western Australia, were studied. Chert layers that are well exposed at Point Samson, 20 km north-northeast of Roebourne consist of various types of chert: white-light gray chert, brownish-yellow chert, gray chert, dark gray chert, massive black chert, and light gray chert. The cherts other than brownish-yellow chert consist mostly of microcrystalline quartz with a minor amount of fine silicate minerals and carbonates. The brownish-yellow chert is characterized by a high concentration of goethite. Most cherts contain thin layers characterized by high concentrations of Ti-bearing minerals such as rutile (anatase), FeTi aggregates, and fine TiO2 grains. Accordingly, Al2O3/TiO2 values in some samples are very low ({$<$}1.0), indicating that these samples contain more TiO2 than Al2O3. This geochemical feature is attributed mainly to the supply of detrital materials with high Ti-bearing minerals to the site of deposition, because the Ti-bearing minerals are generally associated with detrital quartz and zircon. Ti-enriched detrital materials are possibly formed by AlTi fractionation during: (1) extensive chemical weathering, or (2) hydrothermal alteration of the source rocks. In the first hypothesis, which we prefer, it is suggested that low pH values ({$<$}4) of meteoric waters accelerated the decomposition of rock-forming minerals and prevented precipitation of dissolved Al3+. Such low pH values of meteoric waters could have been attributed to more violent volcanic activities issuing acid materials (e.g., H2S and HCl) and/or a higher concentration of atmospheric CO2 in the Archean than today.},

Advances in our understanding of the lithological structure of the northern Aquitaine Basin combined with numerous raw material studies allows connections between different areas of the region to be revealed based on the movement of particular `tracer' materials. By comparing technological data with raw material transport patterns elements of Late Neanderthal techno-economic behaviour emerge. Raw materials were transferred over longer distances in both the Levallois and Quina techno-complexes compared to the Discoid technocomplexes, where evidence for similar movements are almost entirely absent. Comparing these patterns of raw material provisioning and transfer against the distribution of key Middle Palaeolithic sites forms the basis of a new model for the territorial organisation of Late Neandertal groups in the Aquitaine Basin to be built.},

  abstract = {The importance of the transport of stone artefacts in structuring Neandertal lithic assemblages has often been addressed, but the degree to which this led to fragmentation of lithic reduction over Middle Palaeolithic landscapes has not been explicitly studied thus far. Large-scale excavations of Middle Palaeolithic open-air sites and refitting studies of the retrieved assemblages have yielded new, highresolution data on the mobile aspects of Neandertal stone tool technology. In this paper, we integrate lithic technology and raw material data from recent studies of Middle Palaeolithic open-air and rock shelter sites in Western Europe. We demonstrate that the results of a variety of typological, technological (especially refitting), and lithological studies have important consequences for our knowledge of the acquisition of raw materials and subsequent production, usage and discard of stone artefacts in the Middle Palaeolithic. Neandertal production and use of stone tools was fragmented in three domains: the spatial, the temporal and the social domain. We show that this versatile segmentation of stone artefact handling strategies is a main determinant of the character of the Neandertal archaeological record. Our data testify to ubiquitous and continuous transport of stone artefacts of a wide variety of forms, picked by Neandertals using selection criteria that were sometimes far removed from what archaeologists have traditionally considered, and to some degree still consider, to be desired end products of knapping activities. The data presented here testify to the variability and versatility of Middle Palaeolithic stone tool technology, whose fragmented character created very heterogeneous archaeological assemblages, usually the product of a wide variety of independent import, use, discard and/or subsequent transport events.},

The micro-flotation tests revealed that there was little difference in the flotation of feldspar and quartz at pH 2, using H2SO4 as pH regulator. After HF pretreatment, the floatability of feldspar significantly increased while the floatability of quartz showed no change. HF pretreatment resulted in leaching of SiO2 and enrichment of Na, K and Al on the feldspar surface. Consequently, the negative surface charge of feldspar increased at pH 2, which allowed for the flotation separation of the feasible minerals. This took place via an increased electrostatic adsorption between DDA and Na, K, Al on the feldspar surface, which effectively increased its hydrophobicity and as a result, improved the floatability of feldspar. An alternative process which exhibited effective separation of quartz and feldspar while recycling the tailwater from the flotation was proposed.},

Among the elements, Fe and Mg concentrations are highly correlatable as are the relationships between Ca and Sr, or between Ca and CO2. The correlation between Fe and Mg is particularly high for Pacific deep-sea flints and cherts, and for cherts of deep-sea origin from outcrops on land. Enrichments in heavy metals were recognized in some deep-sea cherts; volcanogenic cherts are enriched in Fe, a chert nodule containing basaltic fragments is enriched in Zn and Cr, and biogenically enclosed carbonates in flint nodules are enriched in Mn. The correlation of Fe and Mg and their constant ratio [Mg(\%)/Fe(\%)] of around 0.33 might be characteristic features in the pelagic clays contained in deep-sea flints and cherts, and the concentrations of heavy metals in them would be controlled by the concentrations of FeMg correlated clays. Although the mineralogical nature of the FeMg clay in deep-sea cherts was not clarified by dissolution experiments on opaline minerals in chert, the high concentrations of Fe-montmorillonite and fine-grained olivine or other ferromagnesian silicate minerals in the clay may result in the high correlations between Fe and Mg.},

Traditional models assume a total or virtual depopulation of the interior of the Iberian Peninsula during the Last Glacial. In this paper we present a detailed investigation of human-environment interactions through the first zooarchaeological, taphonomic and isotopic study of the key site of Pe{\~n}a Cap{\'o}n, a rock shelter located in the south-eastern foothills of the Central System range that contains a multi-layered deposit dated to marine isotope stage 2 (MIS 2). Analyses of the faunal assemblages of the Proto-Solutrean (3) and Middle Solutrean (2) layers show that human preferentially hunted horse, deer and iberian ibex living in the vicinity of the rock shelter. Isotope geochemistry of the animal remains of Pe{\~n}a Cap{\'o}n provides us with the first detailed intra-tooth multi-proxy analysis for this time period in south-western Europe, providing estimates of climatic conditions, seasonal flucturation of diet, as well as patterns of seasonal mobility. Our results indicate that human presence at Pe{\~n}a Cap{\'o}n was apparently restricted to relatively warm intervals around the LGM or reflects the presence of an ecological refuge, and provide us with evidence of recurrent human presence in the Iberian interior during the Upper Paleolithic prior to the Magdalenian.},

  abstract = {Shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectroscopy can be applied directly to analyze the mineral chemistry of raw or geologic materials. It provides diagnostic spectral characteristics of the chemical composition of minerals, information that is invaluable for the identification and quality control of such materials. The present study aims to investigate the potential of SWIR spectroscopy as an alternative quality control technique for the mineral chemistry analysis of Portland cement-grade limestone. We used the spectroscopic (wavelength position and depth of absorption feature) and geochemical characteristics of limestone samples to estimate the abundance and composition of carbonate and clay minerals on rock surfaces. The depth of the carbonate (CO3) and Al-OH absorption features are linearly correlated with the contents of CaO and Al2O3 in the samples, respectively, as determined by portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) measurements. Variations in the wavelength position of CO3 and Al-OH absorption features are related to changes in the chemical compositions of the samples. The results showed that the dark gray and light gray limestone samples are better suited for manufacturing Portland cement clinker than the dolomitic limestone samples. This finding is based on the CaO, MgO, Al2O3, and SiO2 concentrations and compositions. The results indicate that SWIR spectroscopy is an appropriate approach for the chemical quality control of cement raw materials.},

  abstract = {In the Franco-Cantabrian region and Catalonia, the Upper Palaeolithic begins with three assemblage-types found in stratigraphic order through the interval between 45,000 and 37,000 years ago: the Ch{\^a}telperronian, the Protoaurignacian, and the Early Aurignacian. A stone tool, the Ch{\^a}telperron point, and a bone tool, the split-based point, are index fossils of the first and the last, respectively, but neither was ever found elsewhere in Iberia. This observation triggered the proposition that, in regions situated to the south of the River Ebro drainage, the Middle Palaeolithic persisted until the time when the Early Aurignacian gave way to the Evolved Aurignacian, which is documented across all of Iberia by assemblages containing its index fossil, the Roc-de-Combe bladelet. Put forth thirty years ago, this Ebro Frontier model found support in the little radiometric evidence then available. Since, it has been shown that most apparently late occurrences of the Middle Palaeolithic were an artefact of dating error, caused by incomplete decontamination of radiocarbon dating samples, while claims have surfaced for the Early Aurignacian to be more widespread than hitherto thought. While the validity of Ebro Frontier's premises has thereby been called into question, continued support for the model is provided by the excavation of new sites, the re-excavation of old ones, the application of luminescence techniques, and the radiocarbon dating of robustly pre-treated samples. Moreover, and highlighting the key role that site formation process and taphonomy continue to play in ongoing controversies, issues of association between the samples and what they are supposed to date cast doubt on the two key claims for the presence of the Early Aurignacian in Andalusia and Portugal. Along with the Iberian System range, the Cantabro-Pyrenean cordillera represents a formidable physical obstacle to travel and communication, potentially enhanced during Last Glacial times because of rapid and major fluctuations in aridity, glacier extent, and plant cover. This barrier effect underpins the divergent culture-historical trajectories that we see unfolding at various times during the Upper Pleistocene. Beyond the Middle-to-Upper Palaeolithic transition, a well-known case in point is the interval between 20,000 and 22,000 years ago, during which the Badegoulian and the Initial Magdalenian of France and northern Spain developed in parallel with facies of the Upper Solutrean and the Solutreo-gravettian then persisting across all Iberian regions situated between Valencia and Portugal. Given known associations between technocomplexes and human types, these regions' Late Mousterian can be taken as a proxy for the persistence of Neandertal populations, and therefore constitutes a case study of choice for analyses of the variation in the intensity and frequency of biological and cultural interactions among low-density, small-scale populations of Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers. Such analyses have implications for models of the spread of genes, populations, and ideas in the course of Human Evolution, which would greatly benefit from due consideration of the issues of historical contingency that the Iberian evidence sheds much light on.},
