# Repositories and Supplementary online materials

All chapters (excluding Introduction and Discussion) have associated online repositories. The materials that would be presented in the dissertation's Appendix section can instead be freely accessed and downloaded through the repositories.

The entirety of the R code used for the analysis, datasets, and visual representations contained in the chapters can be found in their individual repositories. The files include the complete set of raw data used in the analysis, along with the code required to generate all tables and figures, as well as all supplementary materials.

A repository for the full dissertation is also available at <https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/4NYUV>. All article and chapter repositories are compiled here for easier and more centralised access. All communications and posters presented in the context of this research can also be found there. Finally, the dissertation is also hosted in this repository in the **Files** section.

In the following sections I present for each chapter its repository DOI (hosted at osf.io). I also present all supplementary materials and a small description, according to their organisation within the original main folder **Files**.
